I'm an avid gamer, and one of my go-to games is Call of Duty Mobile. I've spent countless hours immersed in its fast-paced action and intense battles. However, one of the issues I have with the game is the game's user interface, and it's affect on my overall satisfaction.

In terms of usability, I would like to highlight the concept of "satisfying." A satisfying user experience is crucial for retaining players and ensuring they enjoy their time in the game. One key aspect of satisfaction is an uncluttered and visually pleasing user interface.

When I launch Call of Duty Mobile, my main interaction occurs within the various screens where I join matches, customize loadouts, and navigate game modes. Unfortunately, the user interface is far from satisfying. The screens are often filled with an overwhelming amount of information. There's so much happening on the screen that it's hard to focus on the most important elements, such as the game mode or my loadout. From the home screen alone, thereâ€™s information that could be filtered out better instead of everything being on said home screen. 

For example, the main lobby screen is a cluttered mess of promotions, event banners, and social features. While these elements are designed to engage players and offer various activities, they can make it challenging to quickly access the core gameplay features even though they are all on the right side of the screen. The clutter not only affects satisfaction but also efficiency as I spend more time searching for what I need.

Another area where the lack of satisfying design is apparent is in the in-game HUD (Heads-Up Display). During a match, the screen is filled with a plethora of information, including my health, ammo count, mini-map, and notifications. While these elements are essential for gameplay, their placement and presentation often feel overwhelming, detracting from the immersive experience. Which can be modified in size, placement, and the ability to completely remove said piece in general. However, it is still a process to find the correct setting to remove or edit the HUD. 

In terms of UX goals, the Call of Duty Mobile app's interface doesn't effectively balance between providing information and ensuring a satisfying user experience. The overload of information can make it hard for players to quickly grasp the most critical aspects of the game, impacting their efficiency and, in turn, their satisfaction.

To address these issues and enhance the user experience, I'd suggest that the developers consider a more streamlined approach to the user interface. They could prioritize the most critical information while providing easy access to secondary features through intuitive menus or interactive tooltips. By decluttering the screens and ensuring that essential elements are prominent, players could have a more satisfying and efficient experience while playing Call of Duty Mobile. In the loading screen instead of having all that information, tall the game modes can be shown if you press play and then you can switch the game mode. Other settings can be put be separated into the item shop. 

In summary, my experience with the Call of Duty Mobile app highlighted issues with screen clutter, affecting both satisfaction and efficiency. The developers should aim to strike a better balance between providing information and offering a more visually pleasing and streamlined user interface.
