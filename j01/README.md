I'm an enthusiastic gamer, and one of my favorite pastimes is immersing myself in the fast-paced action and intense battles of Call of Duty Mobile. However, a significant concern I have revolves around the user interface (UI) of the game and its impact on my overall satisfaction.

To enhance user experience (UX), it's essential to delve into the concept of "satisfying." Achieving a satisfying UX is paramount for retaining players and ensuring they derive enjoyment from the game. A crucial element contributing to satisfaction is an uncluttered and visually appealing UI.

Upon launching Call of Duty Mobile, my primary interactions take place within screens where I join matches, customize loadouts, and navigate various game modes. Regrettably, the UI falls short of providing a satisfying experience. The screens are often inundated with an overwhelming amount of information, making it challenging to focus on crucial elements such as game modes or loadouts. The home screen, for instance, could benefit from improved information filtering, presenting only what's necessary for a smoother experience.

In the attached UX video (UX_video.MOV), the cluttered main lobby screen is evident, featuring promotions, event banners, and social features. While designed to engage players, these elements hinder quick access to core gameplay features, affecting both satisfaction and efficiency. A strategic redesign is needed to enhance the visual appeal and streamline the user journey. Having the main game modes in the lobby and having all the sales and banners of such in the item shop store.

Even in the store we have 9 tabs not including the seperate parts in the featured tab. Instead of having a seperate tab for credit shop and COD points we can have a button next to the amount we have and purchase them that way. 

A similar challenge is observed in the in-game Heads-Up Display (HUD), which displays vital information like health, ammo count, mini-map, and notifications. While essential, their current placement and presentation overwhelm the player, disrupting the immersive experience. Options to customize HUD elements, including size, placement, and removal, could significantly improve user satisfaction. However, finding and implementing these settings should be made more intuitive.

Addressing these UX concerns requires a reevaluation of the Call of Duty Mobile app's interface goals. The current design struggles to strike a balance between providing information and delivering a satisfying user experience, impacting player efficiency. To remedy this, I recommend a streamlined approach, prioritizing critical information and offering easy access to secondary features through intuitive menus or interactive tooltips. The loading screen, for instance, could showcase game modes upon pressing play, allowing seamless mode switching. Other settings could be neatly organized in a separate section, such as the item shop.

In conclusion, my experience with Call of Duty Mobile highlighted issues related to screen clutter, negatively impacting satisfaction and efficiency. Developers should focus on achieving a harmonious balance between information provision and a visually pleasing, streamlined UI to elevate the overall user experience.
